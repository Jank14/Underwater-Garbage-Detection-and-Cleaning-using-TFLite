# Underwater-Garbage-Detection-and-Cleaning-using-TFLite
This project is Computer Vision and IOT based AUV for underwater garbage collection and cleaning.It uses tflite model for garbage detection with almost 80 percent accuracy.The model is trained on 1500 images of 5 classes namely straws,bottle,cans,bags and cups.
The detected garbage would be used and AUV would calculate distance and collect the garbage associated.
Further Work:
  1.Augmentation and training model
  2.Adding new classes of garbage
